# world_cricket_analysis(Data Analysis)
The World Cricket Analysis Project is a comprehensive web application built using Streamlit, Python, and Pandas. It offers in-depth analysis of both men's and women's cricket across all formats, including Test, ODI, and T20.
With a user-friendly interface, the application provides a range of analytical tools and visualizations to examine various aspects of the game. The powerful Plotly libraries are utilized for generating interactive and visually appealing plots.

By analyzing extensive cricket data, users can gain insights into player performance, team statistics, match trends, and much more. The application allows users to compare players, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make data-driven decisions for fantasy cricket teams or cricket betting.

Moreover, the project goes beyond analysis by incorporating deployment on AWS EC2 instance. This ensures the accessibility of the web application to users across the globe, providing them with a seamless experience.

With its robust functionality, intuitive interface, and deployment on a reliable cloud platform, the World Cricket Analysis Project stands out as an exceptional solution for cricket enthusiasts and professionals seeking comprehensive insights and analysis in the world of cricket.

#### Step 1: Data Cleaning During the data cleaning phase, we remove any irrelevant or noisy data, handle missing values, and fix any inconsistencies in the dataset. This process ensures the data is reliable and ready for analysis.

#### Step 2: Data Transformation In this step, we transform the dataset into a suitable format to improve its quality and utility. This may involve converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and applying mathematical operations to feature values for better understanding and processing.

#### Step 3: Feature Engineering Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing dataset that can enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. We identify relationships, interactions, or transformations among the variables and extract valuable information, such as creating new categorical variables, transforming numerical variables, or combining multiple features.

#### Step 4: Feature Extraction Feature extraction focuses on reducing the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting or creating a subset of relevant features that can effectively represent the data.

#### Step 5: Visualization of Men and Women Dataset Using the Streamlit app and Plotly for visualization, we create interactive visualizations to explore and analyze the dataset based on gender and Fomat of Cricket. This includes creating visual representations such as bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, or any other appropriate visualization method to depict patterns, trends, or distributions within the data.

#### Step 6: Deploying on EC2 Instances To make the project accessible over the internet, we deploy it on Amazon EC2 instances. We set up the necessary server infrastructure, configure the environment, and deploy the project, ensuring that it is running securely and efficiently.
